### Array and Struct (part2)

When people actually send money to the contract created at this link https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_solidity_09.git<br>
And we want to keep track of all people who send us money<br>

For that at first we need the data structure ```array```  and we will create array of addresses called ```funders``` <br>

We will keep adding all the funders who send money to us<br>
